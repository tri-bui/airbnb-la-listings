    "##### The maximum value for `minimum_nights` is as high as 1125, which is suspicious because that would be over 3 years. Even with a log-transformation, this variable is right-skewed with a large concentration at 30, which indicates monthly stays. To simplify this variable, we will be grouping the values into 3 bins:\n",
    "- `minimum_nights` of 1 (represented by 1) - these listings have no restrictions on the number of nights stayed\n",
    "- `minimum_nights` between 2 and 29 inclusive (represented by 15) - these listings do have a required minimum but are not monthly stays\n",
    "- `minimum_nights` of at least 30 (represented by 30) - these listings are for monthly stays\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The listing `price` is also highly right-skewed, but with a log-transformation, we can see that the `price` is normally distributed around 100. There are 1,465 listings that cost more than \\\\$765 a night, reaching as high as \\\\$25,000. Here, we are treating `price`s over \\\\$765 as outliers, calculated as 5 times the interquartile range (IQR) added to the 3rd quartile. The reason for using an IQR multiplier of 5 instead of the conventional 1.5 is to capture a lot of the listings in the more expensive areas that would have been cut off with a 1.5-multiplier. Most of the analysis will exclude these outliers, but they may be used later. Another issue with the `price` is the presence of 0s, which is not useful in this case so they will be dropped.\n",
